# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

This project is about the Election Audit that we need to analyze and run using Python and will be given and reported to the Colorado Board of Elections.

With the use of Python, we were able to run and get the following data: Total number of votes casted, votes casted by county, total number and percentage of votes for each candidate, and of course, the winner of the election.

## Election-Audit Summary

The results presented in this report parse through raw data collected through the election ballot process and provides a concise summary of election data by reporting the winner, vote count, and winning percentage. 

As a proposal to the election comissioners, I propose the sale of this script in perpituity, including 20 hours of consultation services that can be used within 180 days from full execution of this proposal for adaptation and configuration to other elections. Two proposed scenarios for use in upcoming election events are noted below:
- Use of script to analyze Mayoral election data with information broken down by local neighborhood within the local municipality.
- Use of this script to analyze Senatorial election data with information broken down by counties within the state.
